# Toto ðŸš½

Toto is a lightweight command-line application that allows you to create and manage todo lists right in your terminal. It keeps your todo lists in a local JSON file for speed and simplicity. 

```

1: welcome
2: to
3: toto!
```

### Subcommands:

add | a <new todo text>: add a new todo item for today. If there is no list for today, one will be created first
edit | e <todo_id> <new todo text>: edit a todo item
complete | c <todo_id>: mark a todo item as complete
incomplete | i <todo_id>: mark a todo as incomplete
delete | d <todo_id>: delete a todo item
